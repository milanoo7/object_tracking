# object_tracking
real time obeject tracking using opencv
ï‚§	To recognize and track the trajectorial movements of any objects, including human in 2D space I have developed an integrated prototype with Raspberry Pi and PiCam as computing unit with suitable image processing library like OpenCV and C++. Final prototype has  efficiency of 95% in detection and tracking the object.
